## 💡 What I'm Building

- 🧾 [**TrackMyBills**](https://github.com/PatientoTyaga/TrackMyBills)  (Completed)
  A smart bill and subscription tracker built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**. Features real-time syncing, upcoming payment reminders, and a sleek dashboard to stay on top of your finances.

### 🚀 TrackMyBills Mobile (Up Next)

An advanced native mobile version of TrackMyBills is in development. This version will go beyond the MVP, incorporating:

- **React Native with Expo** for cross-platform mobile support  
- **AWS services** for scalable backend features like push notifications, file storage (S3), and Lambda functions  
- **Real-world system design principles**, including caching, load balancing, and modular architecture  
- **Offline support** and background syncing for reliability  

This project is an exercise in building production-grade mobile applications, focusing on performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience.
